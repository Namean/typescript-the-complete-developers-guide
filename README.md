[TypeScript: The Complete Developer's Guide](https://www.udemy.com/course/typescript-the-complete-developers-guide/)


There are a few project in the course, they can be found at the following:

- Projects:
  - [Maps](https://github.com/Namean/maps)
  - [Sort](https://github.com/Namean/sort)


### Maps

- [Maps](https://github.com/Namean/maps)
    - Uses Google Maps to display, user defined objects.
    - Demonstrates use of dependency inversion via an interface called Mappable
    - Which allows any object that satisfies, i.e. implements the interface to be display on the map.
    - Uses Parcel to transpile and bundle TypeScript code into the browser



### Sort



The goal of this project is to take each of these different data structures and sort them
from least to greatest.


Array of numbers [10, 5, 18, -3] ---> [-3, 5, 10, 18]
String 'PoaJB' ---> 'aBJoP'
LinkedList [10->-3->27->5] ---> [-3->5->10->27]
